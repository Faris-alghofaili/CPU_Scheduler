FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First)

RR (Round Robin with Quantum = 10)

It features:

Custom Queue implementation.

PCB class to represent processes.

Threads and semaphores to simulate a dispatcher and CPU coordination.

A Gantt chart and detailed statistics output at the end of each simulation.
